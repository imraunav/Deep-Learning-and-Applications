The codes in this folder are for Deeplearning Assignment 1.
For each .py file, change the directory to the appropriate string on the local machine.
For linearly seperable data classifier, the class datas are 3 seperate .txt file.
For non-linearly seperable data classifier, the class datas are in a single .txt file.

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (strictly used for measurements like confusion matrix and mean-squared error)

This folder contains a perceptron_v2.py file. It contains the perceptron class that we designed to use in this assignment.
