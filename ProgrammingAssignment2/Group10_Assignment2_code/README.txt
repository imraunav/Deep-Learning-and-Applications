The codes in this folder are for Deeplearning Assignment 2.
For each .py file, change the directory to the appropriate string on the local machine.
For linearly seperable data classifier, the class datas are 3 seperate .txt file.
For non-linearly seperable data classifier, the class datas are in a single .txt file.
For univariate and bivariate regression, the data is in .csv format.

Packages required for running the codes are as follows,
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (strictly used for measurements like confusion matrix and mean-squared error)

This folder contains a fcnn.py file. It contains the fcnn class and fcnn_2layer class that we designed to use in this assignment.
